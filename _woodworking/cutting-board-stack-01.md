This project was a chance to **batch out a stack of cutting boards** — and it turned out to be incredibly satisfying. Working through a pile of carefully selected hardwood, I built a series of boards in two main styles:

- **Maple boards** with a **single walnut accent stripe**
- **Cherry boards** with **two thin walnut stripes**, and a **maple stripe** between them

Each one was glued up, planed, and sanded to a smooth finish, with rounded edges and corners. Some of the boards were **given to family**, and others were **sold** — but all were made with care.

## Finish

After sanding each board to **P220 grit**, I sprayed them lightly with water to **raise the grain**, then let them dry before giving them a final sanding with **P220 grit**. This helped ensure a smooth surface even after their first wash.

I finished the boards with my own blend of **mineral oil and beeswax** — a food-safe treatment that protects the wood while enhancing the natural beauty of the grain.

## Reflections

Sometimes the simplest projects are the most satisfying. Making these boards in batches let me experiment with design details, work efficiently, and still enjoy the process. It's hard to beat the feeling of turning a stack of rough hardwood into something useful, beautiful — and ready to share.
