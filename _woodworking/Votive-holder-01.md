These votive candle holders started out as a simple piece of **birch firewood**. I resawed and planed the log down to a clean, rectangular blank measuring roughly **2" × 4" × 16"**.

From that single block, I made a set of three candle holders. The votive candles each sit in a **stopped hole** drilled with a Forstner bit. After drilling, I cross-cut the block into three individual pieces, carefully measuring to ensure that the stopped hole would be perfectly centered in each one.

## Cutting the Cove

One of the most interesting parts of this project was cutting a decorative **cove** in the top surface. To do this, I used the **table saw in an unconventional way** — running the block diagonally across the blade between two custom guide rails:

- I planed the edges of two boards flat and clamped them diagonally and parallel on the table saw, 4" apart (matching the width of the block).
- The guide rails were adjusted so the blade was centered between them.
- I raised the blade slightly and passed the block between the rails and over the blade.
- Then I flipped the block end-for-end and repeated the pass to keep the cut symmetrical.
- I continued raising the blade incrementally and repeating the process until the cove reached the desired depth.

This technique requires patience and precision, but it yields a beautiful result.

## Finish

After machining, I sanded progressively from **P80 to P220** grit,
then I applied a hand-rubbed **oil-wax finish**, bringing out the natural tones of the birch.

I made several sets of these candle holders in different sizes. The set pictured below has been sold, but I still have a smaller set in my living room.

## Reflections

I really like how these turned out — they're simple, but elegant, which nicely reflects their humble origin as a piece of firewood. They were fun to make, especially using the table saw in such an unconventional way. Projects like this remind me how satisfying it can be to take a scrap piece of wood and turn it into something worth keeping.
