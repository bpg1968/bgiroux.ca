# Cedar Chest

I built this **cedar chest** for my father-in-law
as a **Father’s Day gift**.
The design comes from a
[U-Build Cedar Chest Plan](https://www.leevalley.com/en-ca/shop/tools/plans/44551-cedar-chest-plan)
—
a classic, clean style that works well
with the natural look and scent of cedar.

For the lid, I used a pair of
[Concealed Lid Hinges](https://www.leevalley.com/en-ca/shop/hardware/hinges/40647-concealed-lid-hinges),
which are **invisible from the outside**
and **self-supporting**:
they open and hold the lid at 90°,
giving the piece a polished and functional finishing touch.

After cutting and assembling all the parts,
I delivered the chest to him **unfinished**,
so he could apply the finish of his choice.

## Reflections

This was a satisfying project
—
solid construction, clean lines,
and a practical gift with a personal connection.
