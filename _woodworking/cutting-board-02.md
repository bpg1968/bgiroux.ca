# Walnut Cutting Boards

## Project Overview

This was a **simple and satisfying project**: a pair of smaller cutting boards, each about **8 by 12 inches**, made from **Black Walnut** with a single contrasting strip of **Maple**.

I used the same basic design for both boards, but experimented with the details:

- One board has **rounded corners** and gently rounded edges
- The other has **45Â° chamfered corners** and crisp chamfered edges

It's a subtle difference, but it really changes the feel of each board in the hand. I ended up **giving one away** and **selling the other**.

## Reflections

This was a **quick project**, but one I really enjoyed. The contrasting Maple strip adds just the right touch, and experimenting with edge treatments gave each board a distinct personality. They both turned out beautifully, and I'm really happy with the results.
