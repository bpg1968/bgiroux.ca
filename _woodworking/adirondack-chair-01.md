# Cedar Adirondack Chairs

## Project Overview

This project was a chance to combine classic outdoor comfort with timeless design. I built a pair of **Adirondack chairs** using [Veritas plans](https://www.leevalley.com/en-ca/shop/tools/plans/32755-adirondack-plus-chair-and-footstool-plan), which feature gentle curves and thoughtful joinery that elevate them above your typical backyard chair.

The goal was to create something durable and beautiful for the front of my **log house**. Once complete, I stained the chairs to match the tone of the logs — and they fit in perfectly.

## Design and Build

- **Material:**  
  I used **cedar**, which is naturally weather-resistant, lightweight, and easy to work with — ideal for outdoor furniture.

- **Plans:**  
  The chairs were built using the **Veritas Adirondack Plus Chair and Footstool Plan** from Lee Valley. The design offers extra back support and a refined silhouette, while still keeping the classic Adirondack profile.

- **Finish:**  
  After assembly, I stained the chairs to match the colour of the log exterior of my house. The warm tone ties the whole scene together.

## Reflections

These chairs have become a welcoming fixture on our front deck. They’re always ready for guests — offering a comfortable spot to relax and take in the surroundings. I’m proud of how they complement the house and quietly invite people to stay awhile.
