This table started out as an **experiment**
—
I wanted to see if I could build something attractive and functional
using nothing but ordinary construction-grade 2×6 lumber.
I had seen a
[YouTube video](https://youtu.be/cc5XQQNE3TY?si=E19OHzsXbOoWVRot)
on
[Ana White's DIY channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AnaWhiteDIY)
and was inspired to give it a try.

I wasn't disappointed.
With a little ripping, careful layout, and simple joinery,
the result was a rock-solid coffee table that’s been
right at home in our living room for more than four years.

All components were ripped from 2×6s:
the legs are essentially 2×4s and
the smaller crosspieces are about 2×2,
all cut down from 2x6s.

## Joinery

I used **pocket hole joinery** throughout the project. While some woodworkers dismiss pocket screws as too weak — especially in applications that might experience racking — I’ve found them to be more than strong enough for this table. After over **four years in our living room**, the joinery is still **rock solid**. I even sit on the table occasionally — and it doesn’t budge.

## Finish

The table is finished with an **English Chestnut stain**, which brought out the grain and gave the softwood a much warmer, more refined look than you’d expect from basic construction lumber.

## Reflections

This project proves that **humble materials** and **simple joinery** can result in a beautiful, durable piece of furniture. We've enjoyed this table in our living room for years, and it’s become a favourite nap spot for our cat, **Chatton**. Not bad for a few 2×6s.
