# Custom Sink-Fitting Cutting Board

## Project Overview

My kitchen peninsula has a small secondary sink — a perfect spot for rinsing vegetables while prepping meals. However, the sink takes up valuable counter space, making the peninsula a little cramped for other uses.

To solve this, I designed and built a **custom cutting board** that fits precisely into the sink opening. When placed into the opening, the cutting board rests securely on the small lip where the under-mount sink meets the underside of the countertop. This clever solution temporarily extends the counter surface, giving me a much larger work area when I don't need the sink.

When I'm preparing vegetables, I simply lift the cutting board out, set it beside the sink, and use it for chopping while keeping the sink accessible for rinsing.

As an added bonus, the cutting board also fits nicely over one half of my main kitchen sink, which is a double sink — adding even more versatility.

## Design and Build

- **Fit and Function:**  
  The cutting board was carefully sized to match the sink opening, both in width and thickness, ensuring a flush and stable surface with the countertop.

- **Material:**  
  I used **Hard Maple**, chosen for its durability, food safety, and attractive appearance.

- **Construction:**  
  Precise measurements were critical. I templated the sink opening, then planed and sanded the cutting board to achieve the right thickness. The edges were finished smoothly for easy handling and a clean fit.

- **Finish:**  
  I treated the board with my own custom blend of mineral oil and beeswax — **"Brian’s 2-Step Cutting Board Wax"** — which protects the wood and brings out its natural beauty.

## Reflections

I've been using this cutting board almost daily for **nearly five years**, and I still love it.  
It remains a simple, functional, and durable upgrade to my kitchen workspace.

Projects like this are a reminder of what I enjoy most about woodworking: creating practical, beautiful items that improve everyday life.
