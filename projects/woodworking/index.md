# Woodworking Projects

Welcome to my collection of woodworking projects.

Each piece here was made by hand â€” sometimes out of necessity, sometimes for the joy of building, and sometimes just to see if I could pull it off. Some are practical, others experimental, but they all share one thing: they were made with care.
