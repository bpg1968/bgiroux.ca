# Software Projects

I enjoy building small, focused software projects — sometimes they're practical tools, and other times they're just fun exercises to sharpen my skills.
Many of these projects were created out of personal curiosity, to solve a real-world need, or simply to explore an idea that interested me.

Here you will find a selection of my software work, ranging from system utilities to algorithmic experiments.
