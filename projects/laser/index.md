# {{ page.title }}

Our laser projects are a collaborative effort between my wife and me.
She handles the creative side
—
coming up with original designs or sourcing them from talented makers
—
and she also runs the laser machines.
I focus on the hands-on work:
sanding, glue-ups, and most of the finishing,
though she often lends a hand there too.
We each bring our own strengths to the process,
and the result is a blend of precision, artistry, and teamwork.

We work almost exclusively with wood, using both thin plywood and solid stock.
Our laser engraver can etch fine detail
and cut up to a quarter inch of solid maple.
We’ve made everything from children’s puzzles and games
to phone stands, keychains, and decorative pieces.
Whether it’s a playful gift or something practical,
each item is carefully made with a focus on quality and character.
