This was one of my very first laser projects.

I took a maple cutting board from a [batch of cutting boards](/projects/woodworking/cutting-board-stack-01/) I had made earlier and engraved a simple design onto it: the words *"together is our favourite place to be"* with a small heart above. It was a short, sentimental phrase—nothing too ambitious—but for a test run, it felt just right.

I was really just cutting my teeth with the laser at this point, but I was impressed when it came off the machine. The engraving was crisp, clean, and added a personal touch to a piece I had already put care into. It turned out better than expected and gave me the confidence to keep exploring what was possible with laser work on wood.
