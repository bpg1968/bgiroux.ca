June marks *National Indigenous History Month* in Canada — a time to celebrate the history, heritage, and diversity of First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples. It’s an opportunity to honour their stories, cultures, and ongoing contributions, while also reflecting on the truths of our shared past.

The House of Commons officially recognized June as a month to celebrate Indigenous history in 2009, creating space for education, recognition, and reflection across the country.

This month is a chance to engage with Indigenous voices — through books, films, music, and art. Attend a local event, explore Indigenous storytelling, or deepen your understanding of the cultures around you. June 21 is also [*National Indigenous Peoples Day*](https://www.rcaanc-cirnac.gc.ca/eng/1100100013718/1708446948967), aligned with the summer solstice, a day of spiritual significance for many Indigenous communities.

Understanding that history also means acknowledging the impact of colonialism. Learn about the legacy of residential schools through the [*National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation*](https://nctr.ca/records/reports/), or explore the [*Reconciliation: A Starting Point*](https://www.csps-efpc.gc.ca/tools/apps/ils/index-eng.aspx) app. The [*National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls*](https://www.mmiwg-ffada.ca/) offers further insight into ongoing systemic issues.

You can also explore a [map of Indigenous communities and traditional territories](https://geo.sac-isc.gc.ca/geoviewer-geovisualiseur/index-eng.html) or [Native Land Digital](https://native-land.ca/) to better understand the land you live on, and consider incorporating land acknowledgements into your own practices.

Join the conversation online using #NIHM2025 to help raise awareness. Whether you’re learning, listening, or sharing, every step brings us closer to understanding, respect, and reconciliation.
