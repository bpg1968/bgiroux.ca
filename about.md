My background brings together technology and craftsmanship: I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from [Laurentian University](https://laurentian.ca/), and I run [**Giroux Woodcraft**](https://girouxwoodcraft.ca/), where I design and create handmade wood products.

Outside of work, I enjoy contributing to meaningful projects, volunteering as a community driver, and finding ways to use technology to make a positive impact. I believe in working with care, sharing what I learn, and creating things that are both useful and well-crafted.

I also believe in the transformative potential of artificial intelligence. This website was built with heavy reliance on AI tools — a reflection of how technology and human creativity can work together.

This site is a place where I share my projects, my writing, and my thoughts — a reflection of the many areas where curiosity, care, and craft meet.

Thanks for stopping by. I hope you enjoy exploring.
